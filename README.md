# Recommendation-system
Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders. In this notebook, we will explore Content-based recommendation systems and implement a simple version of one using Python and the Pandas library.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Content-Based Filtering

##### Advantages

*   Learns user's preferences
*   Highly personalized for the user

##### Disadvantages

*   Doesn't take into account what others think of the item, so low quality item recommendations might happen
*   Extracting data is not always intuitive
*   Determining what characteristics of the item the user dislikes or likes is not always obvious

Now it's time to start our work on recommendation systems.

The first technique we're going to take a look at is called Collaborative Filtering, which is also known as User-User Filtering. As hinted by its alternate name, this technique uses other users to recommend items to the input user. It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input. There are several methods of finding similar users (Even some making use of Machine Learning), and the one we will be using here is going to be based on the Pearson Correlation Function.

The process for creating a User Based recommendation system is as follows:

*   Select a user with the movies the user has watched
*   Based on his rating of the movies, find the top X neighbours
*   Get the watched movie record of the user for each neighbour
*   Calculate a similarity score using some formula
*   Recommend the items with the highest score

#### Similarity of users to input user

Next, we are going to compare all users (not really all !!!) to our specified user and find the one that is most similar.\
We're going to find out how similar each user is to the input through the **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**. It is used to measure the strength of a linear association between the two variables. The formula for finding this coefficient between sets X and Y with N values can be seen in the image below.

Why Pearson Correlation?

Pearson correlation is invariant to scaling, i.e. multiplying all elements by a nonzero constant or adding any constant to all elements. For example, if you have two vectors X and Y, then, pearson(X, Y) == pearson(X, 2 \* Y + 3). This is a pretty important property in recommendation systems because, for example, two users might rate two series of items totally differently in terms of absolute rates, but they would be similar users (i.e. with similar ideas) with similar rates in various scales .

The values given by the formula vary from r = -1 to r = 1, where 1 forms a direct correlation between the two entities (it means a perfect positive correlation) and -1 forms a perfect negative correlation.

In our case, a 1 means that the two users have similar tastes while a -1 means the opposite.


### Advantages and Disadvantages of Collaborative Filtering

##### Advantages

*   Takes other user's ratings into consideration
*   Doesn't need to study or extract information from the recommended item
*   Adapts to the user's interests which might change over time

##### Disadvantages

*   Approximation function can be slow
*   There might be a low amount of users to approximate
*   Privacy issues when trying to learn the user's preferences

# About Data Set

Summary
=======

This dataset (ml-latest) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. It contains 22884377 ratings and 586994 tag applications across 34208 movies. These data were created by 247753 users between January 09, 1995 and January 29, 2016. This dataset was generated on January 29, 2016.

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 1 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.

The data are contained in four files, `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`. More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.

This is a *development* dataset. As such, it may change over time and is not an appropriate dataset for shared research results. See available *benchmark* datasets if that is your intent.

This and other GroupLens data sets are publicly available for download at <http://grouplens.org/datasets/>.



========================

Formatting and Encoding
-----------------------

The dataset files are written as [comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files with a single header row. Columns that contain commas (`,`) are escaped using double-quotes (`"`). These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Mis√©rables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.

User Ids
--------

MovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).

Movie Ids
---------

Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id `1` corresponds to the URL <https://movielens.org/movies/1>). Movie ids are consistent between `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `links.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).


Ratings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)
-----------------------------------------

All ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:

    userId,movieId,rating,timestamp

The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.

Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).

Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.

Tags Data File Structure (tags.csv)
-----------------------------------

All tags are contained in the file `tags.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:

    userId,movieId,tag,timestamp

The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.

Tags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.

Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.

Movies Data File Structure (movies.csv)
---------------------------------------

Movie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:

    movieId,title,genres

Movie titles are entered manually or imported from <https://www.themoviedb.org/>, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.

Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:

* Action
* Adventure
* Animation
* Children's
* Comedy
* Crime
* Documentary
* Drama
* Fantasy
* Film-Noir
* Horror
* Musical
* Mystery
* Romance
* Sci-Fi
* Thriller
* War
* Western
* (no genres listed)

Links Data File Structure (links.csv)
---------------------------------------

Identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file `links.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:

    movieId,imdbId,tmdbId

movieId is an identifier for movies used by <https://movielens.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https://movielens.org/movies/1>.

imdbId is an identifier for movies used by <http://www.imdb.com>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/>.

tmdbId is an identifier for movies used by <https://www.themoviedb.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862>.

Use of the resources listed above is subject to the terms of each provider.

Cross-Validation
----------------

Prior versions of the MovieLens dataset included either pre-computed cross-folds or scripts to perform this computation. We no longer bundle either of these features with the dataset, since most modern toolkits provide this as a built-in feature. If you wish to learn about standard approaches to cross-fold computation in the context of recommender systems evaluation, see [LensKit](http://lenskit.org) for tools, documentation, and open-source code examples.
